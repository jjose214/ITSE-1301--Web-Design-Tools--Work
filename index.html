            <article>
                <h3 class="title"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: #704427;">In short, Kanye West is one of the most influential musicians of all time. West was born in Atlanta but raised in Chicago, and ever since he was young he had a passion for creating music. This passion eventually led him to dropping out of college at the age of 20, in order to pursue music professionally. Kanye started off producing, but his goal was to become a rapper. Eventually, he would go on to release many critically acclaimed albums and becoming the artist he is today.</p>
                <p style="color: #704427;">Before he went on to release full-length albums, he produced for many noteable artists like Ludacris, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson, etc. As he tried to shift towards pursuing rap rather than producing, he ended up getting what he wished for because of a terrible accident. He fell asleep driving from a long recording session, and ended up writing <em>Through the Wire</em> while he was at the hospital. After these events, he went on to release a trilogy of albums. These three albums that were centered around academia themes were: <em>The College Dropout</em>, <em>Late Registration</em>, and <em>Graduation</em>. During this time, he ended up winning American Music Awards, Grammy Awards, BET Awards, as well as many other noteable awards. It is safe to say that Kanye was very successful during his career early on.</p>
                <p style="color: #704427;">As time went on, Kanye dove deeper into fashion. Anything he wore would soon become a staple in everyones closet. From the famous shutter shades to chunky dad shoes to earth tones, Kanye's influence is very present. Since anything that West wore became a trend, what better way to market your own designs than to wear unreleased versions and get people to anticipate their release. This is how Kanye ended up building his multi-billion dollar Yeezy empire.</p>

            <a id="THE_KANYE_COSIGN"><h2 class="title"><strong>The Kanye Cosign</strong></h2></a>
            <article>
                <h3 class="title"><strong>Talent Meets Talent</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: #af6b3e;">A lot of famous and talented musicians have origins that lead back to Kanye, whether they produced for him, he mentored them, or simply just cosigned them. This is not to take away from the artists' talent either, because they all made a name for themselves before Kanye. The power of a Kanye cosign can lead artits to more success and a push into the spotlight.</p>
                <p style="color: #af6b3e;">A good example of this is Travis Scott, who would later become one of the most popular rappers in the world. Kanye helped Travis with his <em>Owl Pharaoh</em> mixtape. They've also collabed on many songs, like Scott's <em>3500</em> and West's <em>Wash Us In The Blood</em>.</p>
                <p style="color: #af6b3e;">Another great example is Chief Keef, Kanye remixed Keef's first hit <em>I Don't Like</em> and now everyone wanted to work with Chief Keef. Chief Keef's talent speaks for itself as he fathered many sounds and style's. It is not a stretch to say Chief Keef is one of the most influential artists for today's music, as well as his music being timeless.</p>
                <p style="color: #af6b3e;">Finally, the Venezuelan-born producer Arca, who helped produce Kanye's album <em>Yeezus</em>. After producing for Kanye, she went on to work with artists like Bj√∂rk and FKA Twigs. She has now gained a loyal following and continues to showcase that her talent is limitless.</p>
